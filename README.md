# Mac Media Key Forwarder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/milgra/macmediakeyforwarder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/milgra/macmediakeyforwarder#)

Mac Media Key Forwarder for [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) and [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com).

Forwards media keys to iTunes or Spotify directly.

You can prioritize which app you would like to control or you can go with the default behaviour which controls the running app.

The app runs in the menu bar.

Download the compiled application from my [Releases](https://github.com/quentinlesceller/macmediakeyforwarder/releases).

If you want even more control over what you want to control you should try [beardedspice](http://beardedspice.github.io).

**Issues you should know about**

The app listens on the event tap for key events. This causes problems in some rare cases, like 
- when changing search engine in Safari's preferences window
- when trying to allow third-party kernel extensions

In these cases simply pause Mac Media Key Forwarder from it's menu.

**Installation & MacOS Mojave Compatibility**

The app itself is compatible with Mojave, but you need to add it as trusted application in order to make it function properly.

You can do this with these steps:
1. Go to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy**
2. Open the **Privacy** tab, and look for **Accessibility** in the left list
3. Turn on the checkbox for **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app** in the right list
2. Look for **Automation** in the left list
3. Turn on the checkbox for **iTunes.app** and **Spotifiy.app** under **MacMediaKeyForwarder.app** in the right list
4. Run the app again
